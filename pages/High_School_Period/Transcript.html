									<p>I obtained 34 out of 30 required credits during my secondary education, achieving an average mark of 96.0%. 
									</p>
									<p>
										While I was in Grade 10 & 11 the Lord Selkirk School Division started the Enrichment Program, in which smarter 
										students could take more challenging courses to better prepare for university, with the goal of students taking first year university 
										courses in Grade 12. Thus I took many enriched courses, completing Grade 12 level mathematics, physics, and chemistry by the end of Grade 11. 
										However the school division cancelled the Enrichment Program while I was finishing Grade 11, and I was not able to take university courses in
										Grade 12. Thankfully my mathematics and chemistry teachers (Ms. Bulawka and Mr. Wiebe) ran their usual advanced courses, such that I could still
										learn interesting things during my last year of high school.
