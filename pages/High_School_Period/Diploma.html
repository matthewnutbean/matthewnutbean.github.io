									<p>I achieved Honours with Distinction with my diploma, due to my average mark being greater than 90%.</p>
									<p>My high school focused more on teaching trades, with the various majors reflecting this. Since I took as many STEM courses
									as possible, my set of courses did not fall into any specilized majors, with my major being the default and boring "General
									Studies Major".
