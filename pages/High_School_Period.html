										<h2>High School Period</h2>
									</header>
									<p>This period of my life took place from September 2015 to June 2019, starting in Grade 9 while attending Lockport School,
										with the remaining years of my secondary education taking place at Lord Selkirk Regional Comprehensive Secondary School.
										I did not participate in many extracurricular activities during this time due to a lack of STEM clubs. However I did write 
										math and science contests for fun, with the ones I did well in shown on the Awards page.
