											<h1>Home</h1>
											<p>Welcome to my website!</p>
										</header>
									</div>
									<p>My name is Matthew Nutbean, and I have interests in engineering, robotics, and planetary exploration. I graduated with my bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in 
									June 2025, and I have made many accomplishments up to this point. With that busy period now behind me, I decided to make this website to catelog my accomplishments and 
									work; both for my own sake, and to help me gain opportunities.
									</p>
									<p>In terms of how to navigate my website, a short introduction is given in this home page for readers to get a professional summary of myself. The remaining pages can be 
										reached with the top navigation bar. I have split up my professional life into periods, with the bulk of the website's information being given in these pages. Both my
										High School Period and Undergraduate Period contains important educational information (degree/diploma, transcript, and awards); while my Undergraduate Period in addition
										contains a portfolio of my projects to display my skills, and a summary of important conferences and workshops I have attended.
									</p>
									<p>
										For any recruiters in a hurry, the below two buttons will be useful.
