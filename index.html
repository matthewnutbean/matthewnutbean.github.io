											<h1>Home</h1>
											<p>Welcome to my website!</p>
										</header>
									</div>
									<p>My name is Matthew Nutbean, and I have interests in engineering, robotics, and planetary exploration. I graduated with my bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in 
									June 2025, and I have made many accomplishments up to this point. With that busy period now behind me, I decided to make this website to catelog my accomplishments and 
									work; both for my own sake, and to help me gain opportunities.
									</p>
									<p>In terms of how to navigate my website, a short introduction is given in this home page for readers to get a professional summary of myself. The remaining pages can be 
										reached with the top navigation bar. I have split up my professional life into periods, with the bulk of the website's information being given in these pages. Both my
										High School Period and Undergraduate Period contains important educational information (degree/diploma, transcript, and awards); while my Undergraduate Period in addition
										contains a portfolio of my projects to display my skills, and a summary of important conferences and workshops I have attended. The remaining two pages contains my resume,
										and contact information to get a hold of me.
									</p>
									<p>
										For any recruiters in a hurry, the below two buttons will be useful.

								      <p>
										  I have had many interests relating to engineering since my youth, but the most persistent interest throughout my life has been planetary exploration. In my youth 
										  I read many books and watched many documentaries about the exploration of the solar system. I was captivated by the many wonderous worlds of the solar system, 
										  and humanity's attempts to visit and learn more about these worlds. The spacecrafts which performed these journeys became personalities to me, with notable personanlities 
										  including: Voyager 1 & 2, Cassini, and Opportunity. They have inspired me to pursue a career in aerospace engineering, with my goal for the capstone of my career to 
										  work on my own interplanetary mission.
									  </p>
									  <p>
										  The main thing which drives me is exploration. I am simply curious about how the universe works on a planetary scale, and I want to work on missions which help deepens humanity's knowledge on this topic.
										  The mission concept which interest me the most at present is studying the oceans of icy moons, such as Europa and Enceladus. A quote from an Arthur C. Clarke book comes to mind when I think
										  of this mission concept: "All these worlds are yours, except Europa. Attempt no landings there." I would like to disobey this message and determine whether or not there is life to disturb
										  on Jupiter's icy moon. My secondary motivation is the technical challenge. The reason why I pursued mechanical engineering is because I love designing and building things. Working towards an interplantary
										  mission will only sharpen my skills as a mechanical engineer.
