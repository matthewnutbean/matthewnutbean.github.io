											<h1>Home</h1>
											<p>Welcome to my website!</p>
										</header>
									</div>
									<p>My name is Matthew Nutbean, and I have interests in engineering, robotics, and planetary exploration. I graduated with my bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in 
									June 2025, and I have made many accomplishments up to this point. With that busy period now behind me, I decided to make this website to catelog my accomplishments and 
									work; both for my own sake, and to help me gain opportunities.
									</p>
									<p>In terms of how to navigate my website, a short introduction is given in this home page for readers to get a professional summary of myself. The remaining pages can be 
										reached with the top navigation bar.

								    <h2>Motivation</h2>
								    <p>
								      Inspired by space exploration missions such as Spirit and Opportunity,
								      I pursued aerospace engineering and robotics to help build the next
								      generation of exploration systems.
